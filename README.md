# ♻️ Open Waste Exchange (OWE)

Open Waste Exchange (OWE) is a **community-driven digital marketplace** for recycling. It connects:

- **Sources of recyclable waste**: individuals, hostels, offices  
- **Collectors**: NGOs, recyclers, volunteers  

The application is built as a **highly performant Single-Page Application (SPA)** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, optimized for fast navigation and rapid development (great for hackathons or demos).

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Single-Page Experience**: Fast navigation across Landing, Auth, Dashboard, Postings, and Map without page reloads.  
- **Real-Time Map View**: Integrates **Leaflet.js** and **React-Leaflet** to display all waste postings geographically.  
- **Gamification Prototype**: Badges and Leaderboard to encourage community participation.  
- **Intuitive Posting**: Users can post items (Plastic, E-Waste, Clothes) with simulated image uploads.  
- **User Tracking**: Dashboard summarizes contributions (Items, Kilograms Saved, Leaderboard Rank).  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router, JavaScript/JSX)  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, responsive design)  
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js + React-Leaflet

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)  
- npm or yarn  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
# Core dependencies
npm install next react react-dom
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# Mapping dependencies
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
````

### 2️⃣ Configure Key Files

| File                | Purpose                      | Notes                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/page.jsx`      | Main app component           | Must start with `"use client";`                                           |
| `postcss.config.js` | Enables Tailwind compilation | Must export `{ plugins: { tailwindcss: {}, autoprefixer: {} } }`          |
| `app/globals.css`   | Imports Tailwind base styles | Must include `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` |

### 3️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🗺️ Mapping Note

The MapView component uses Leaflet markers that rely on direct CDN links:

```javascript
L.Icon.Default.mergeOptions({
  iconRetinaUrl: '...',
  iconUrl: '...',
  shadowUrl: '...',
});
```

This ensures markers display correctly in **React-Leaflet** with Next.js/Webpack. Already included in `app/page.jsx`.

## ⚡ Notes

* This project is currently a **prototype** for hackathons or demonstrations.
* Features such as image uploads are **simulated** and may not persist data.
* Contributions and improvements are welcome!

```

I can also make a **more visually appealing version with badges, demo links, and contribution instructions** so it looks like a polished GitHub repo.  

Do you want me to do that next?
